A simple website to estimate how many free stars you can collect before a specific card or banner.
It uses JP server data (since EN is behind), so anything available on JP but not yet released on EN is included in the estimate.

---

## ✨ Features
This website adds up all the free stars you can get from different sources, which includes:

### 🗓️ Events
- Story rewards
- Point milestones
- Ranking rewards

### 🎵 Songs
- Score rewards (S / SS)
- Full combo rewards (Hard / Expert / Special)

### 🌤️ Daily Rewards
- **150 stars per week** from login bonuses
- **1 star gacha ticket weekly** from daily live

### 🔧 Effort Adjustment
Customize the estimated rewards based on how much you intend to grind.
You can adjust things like:
- Which **song difficulties** you plan to full combo
- Your **target event points**
- Your **target event ranking**
- Whether you want to count specific types of rewards or skip them
